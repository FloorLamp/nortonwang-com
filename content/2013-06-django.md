Title: Setting up Django and Wordpress together

Going from a fresh Ubuntu install to a functioning django and wordpress site is pretty
simple. I mostly borrowed the instructions from [here][].

Before you begin, you should go to your domain name provider and set an
A (address) record for your domain name to your instance's IP address.
If you don't have a domain name,Â *buy one*. Unless you have a really
common name, or are building www.facebook.com, domain names are cheap
and will only increase in demand in the future. I'm using example.com
as the django site, and blog.example.com as the wordpress site.

### Django

Install dependencies. I use a standard apache/mysql/python stack:

    sudo apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-wsgi python python-pip
    mysql-server python-mysqldb
    pip install django

Create your Django project somewhere:

    cd /usr/local/src/
    sudo django-admin.py startproject myproject

Next, create an apache config for your main site:

    touch /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/example.com  

and put this in it:

    <VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName example.com
    WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/apache/django.wsgi
    <Directory /var/www/apache>
    Order deny,allow
    Allow from all
    </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>

Create a wsgi file:

    touch /var/www/apache/django.wsgi  

and put this in it:

    :::python
    import os, sys  
    root = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '/usr/local/src')  
    sys.path.insert(0, root)  
    sys.path.append('/var/www')  
    sys.path.append('/usr/local/src/myproject')  
    os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'myproject.settings'  
    import django.core.handlers.wsgi  
    application = django.core.handlers.wsgi.WSGIHandler()  

Set some permissions:

    chmod o+r /var/www/apache/django.wsgi  
    chmod o+rx /var/www/apache  
    chmod o+rx /usr/local/src  

Restart apache:

    sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload  
    sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart  

Now, navigate to example.com. if everything went ok, you should see the
Django success page. If not, check your apache logs and make sure your
DNS records are correct and have propagated.

### Wordpress
Next up is wordpress on a subdomain. Follow the directions [here][1].

After that, we still need to configure apache for this site:

    touch /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/blog.example.com  

Put this in it:

    <VirtualHost *:80>  
    ServerName blog.example.com  
    DocumentRoot /var/www/wordpress  
    </VirtualHost>

Restart apache again. And that's it. Visit
blog.example.com/wp-admin/install.php to set up wordpress. Make sure to
set WordPress Address and Site Address (in settings) to
blog.example.com, so your links are correct.
