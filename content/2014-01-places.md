Title: Where I went in 2013

2013 was my first full year on Foursquare, so I thought it would be interesting to take a look at my data. Foursquare itself doesn't have great visualization or analysis tools built in, but there are a few third party services that do that. The main one I use is [4sqmap](http://www.4sqmap.com/), which offers a great map of all my checkins. Here's what my 2013 looked like:

I didn't really leave the northeast, except for a trip to Austin.

### Data extraction

Unfortunately, 4sqmap doesn't have a way to view your checkin data by date. So, I decided to just do it myself. I wrote <a href="https://gist.github.com/FloorLamp/8273330" target="_blank">this python script</a> to grab my year of checkins and process it. It does the following:

* Gets all checkins from 1/1/13 to 12/31/13
* Gets total number of checkins for each venue and sorts it
* Gets total number of checkins for each category and sorts it
* Gets the root category that each category belongs to
* For each week, gets total number of checkins per root category
* Dumps everything to csv files

The script contains a few too many for-comprehensions, but it works.

### Venues and categories

Here are my top venues for the year (if you didn't know, I'm a fan of Chipotle):

### Lunch
    
With the exception of Chipotle and Starbucks, all of my top venues are places I went for lunch during the first half of the year. I went to a lot of the same places multiple times.

This map shows my lunch spots from January to June. Almost all of them fall within a 4 block radius of my office, which was located at 34th and 5th. That's also where the Empire State Building is, or as I like to call it, the Chipotle building, since there's a Chipotle at ground level.

In September I started a new job at Union Square. I decided to be more adventurous this time, and went to Chipotle once a week and a new place the rest of the week. Here were the results:

Now, the furthest I went was 8 blocks, or twice as far as before. This is a necessary evil of going to new places all the time. Union Square is awesome because it has _so much stuff_, but I'm slowly running out of new places to go. Eventually I'll have to start taking the subway up or down a stop, just to get lunch.

### Categories over time

This is the weekly snapshot of my checkins. There's a few trends I see:

* I like food
* There was a spike in offices and tech startups in July, when I was interviewing
* The spike on 2/3 was when I went to a bunch of tourist places
* The spike in 'food' on 6/30 was because I went on a wine tour, and wineries count as food
* The huge spike on 9/1 was when I went to Austin
* The only thing I did at the end of the year was drink


### Conclusion

My main take away from this is that I really, _really_ like Chipotle. I was the mayor of the 34th Street Chipotle until I stopped working there. I'm currently the mayor of the Union Square Broadway Chipotle, with a 15-week checkin streak.

A lot of people dislike Foursquare and say that it's not necessary or not useful, that Yelp or Google are better, that checkins are too much of a hassle, etc. That's fine - I agree with most of those points. I only use it as a personal log of where I've been. The gamification, tips, recommendations and all that are secondary. As long as checkins remain easy, I will keep using Foursquare.
