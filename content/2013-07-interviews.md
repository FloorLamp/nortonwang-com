I've been interviewing a lot lately, and I've come across a lot of
mundance technical interview questions, along with some more interesting
ones. I've put together a list of them below, and I'll try to keep this
updated when I have more interviews.

## The interesting ones

-   Write a function to calculate the
    square root of a float.
-   You are
    given a 100 boxes with 100 balls in each, each ball weighing 1. One
    box’s balls weigh 0.99. You have a scale that can do 1 weighing.
    Find the lighter box. You may modify the boxes however you
    like.
-   Write a Javascript function to return n copies of a string without
    using a for loop.
-   Write a function to return all n digit numbers. Now, change that
    function to only return numbers that have sum s. Now, change that
    function again to return only the first instance of each sum.
-   What is the difference between the World Wide Web and the Internet?
    What about an internet and an intranet?
-   You have a database table with products and quantities. How do you
    prevent overselling when many users buy the product at the same
    time?
-   Write a function to take a random sample from an array. Now, change
    that function to instead use an iterator with methods .next() and
    .hasnext()
-   You're making a Twitter clone. What is the database schema? How do
    you get a user's stream? How do you scale?
-   Determine if a paragraph is a plagiarized from another paragraph.
-   Given an infinite input of timestamps and stock prices, you need
    access to min/max and last price. Timestamps may be repeated or sent
    out of order. If a time is repeated, it overwrites the previous one.
-   Given a list of words and a sequence of numbers that correspond to
    letters on a phone, return all possible words with that prefix.
-   Given an array of numbers corresponding to building heights, how
    much water remains if it rains and fills in all the building spaces?

## The stupidly common ones
If you are interviewing, I would recommend knowing everything here inside and out.

-   Describe OOP.
-   Describe hash tables. Describe binary trees. Describe binary search.
    Runtimes of everything.
-   What is the difference between x language and y language? (eg.
    python and javascript)
-   What is good and bad about x language?
-   Write a function to return duplicates from an array.
-   Write a recursive function to sum an array, or to reverse a string.
-   Reverse a linked list. Detect cycles in a linked list.
-   Dynamic programming questions, eg. Levenshtein distance and longest
    increasing subsequence.
-   Use DFS/BFS to solve graph problems.
-   Describe MVC.
-   Describe SQL joins.
-   Describe locking and atomicity.
-   What happens when you enter www.google.com in your browser and hit
    enter?

## Javascript

-   What are the types in JS?
-   What is the difference between == and ===? (I hate this one because
    I've literally heard it 5+ times)
-   Describe prototypal inheritance.
-   What is a closure? (not JS specific, but this is usually asked with
    the other JS questions)
-   Describe scoping. What is hoisting?

## Python

-   What is a generator?
    What is a decorator?
-   Why does multithreading suck?
-   How does lazy loading in Django work?
