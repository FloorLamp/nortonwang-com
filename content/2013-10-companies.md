Title: Startups vs large companies

I've been working at my current job for over a month now, and so far
it's been way different than my last one. My last company was a tiny
startup, so it was just me and two other guys in a tiny room big enough
for a few desks. Now, I'm at a large public enterprise company. The
aisle that I sit in has more people than my last company. Here are some
of the differences that I've noticed.

### People

**Then**

-   I saw the same two people every single day. Occasionally we'd have
    some part-time people come in.
-   When one of them wasn't there for a day, it was very noticeable.
-   I pretty much knew what everyone else was up to, and if not I could
    just spin in my chair and ask them.
-   Our business, product, and engineering departments each took up
    maybe 30 square feet.

**Now**

-   My office has 40+ people (our NY office is relatively new).
-   I still don't know half of them, since they're salespeople and I
    never interact with them. I have absolutely no idea what some of
    them do on a day to day basis.
-   We have junior engineers, senior engineers, engineering managers,
    product managers, marketing people, sales people, client relations
    people, designers, and vice presidents
-   Even within our engineers, I have very limited knowledge about what
    the other teams are working on.
-   The other week, our CEO showed up, and I had no idea who he was.
-   Our main headquarters, in Austin, has *multiple floors* of a large
    building.
-   And finally, there are people here who are *not* male Cornell
    graduates in their 20s

### Engineering

**Then**

-   I pretty much had to solve all problems on my own. When in doubt,
    Google.
-   My decision was the ultimate decision. If I was wrong, well, that
    sucks.
-   I could get away with writing maybe not the best code, because I was
    basically the only one who saw it.
-   I could pretty much work on whatever item or feature I wanted to
    since there wouldn't be any conflicts.

**Now**

-   If I have a Javascript question, all I have to do is ask the dude
    next to me. If I have a Java question, all I have to do is ask the
    dude behind me. If I have an AWS question, there's another dude for
    that.
-   Since I actually have team members now, I have to coordinate with
    them and divide up work.
-   People smarter than me will tell me if I'm doing something the wrong
    way.

### Culture

**Then**

-   Wore shorts, came in at 11, ate chipotle
-   Google apps, Asana, pirated Photoshop

**Now**

-   Wear shorts, come in at 11, eat chipotle
-   We have free snacks in the kitchen!
-   Unfortunately, being an enterprise means you have to use things like
    Outlook and Jira, and pay for Photoshop
