2013 was a pretty good year. Here are some things I did:

* Started blogging
* Experienced the [death of a startup]({filename}/2013-06-startup.md) and saw the birth of a [new one](thegenesisblock.com)
* [Interviewed]({filename}/2013-07-interviews.md) a bunch of companies and got a [new job]({filename}/2013-08-jobs.md)
* Learned all sorts of new languages and frameworks: Ruby, Scala, Node.js, Angular.js, d3.js
* Learned about a variety of topics, including financial markets, crypotgraphy, and macroeconomics
* Completed a Coursera class
* Made the front page of Hacker News by [being dumb]({filename}/2013-11-hacked.md)
* Made my first [open source contribution](https://github.com/omab/python-social-auth/commit/442ca5ec3ec140268dc34e589a8277d81547478f)
* Started doing freelance work
* Bought some bitcoin and dogecoin (wow)
* Went to 5 concerts

### Goals for 2014

* Finish side projects. I have way too many side projects where I work on intensely for a few days and then stop.
* Do more open source work. Contribute to bigger projects.
* Write more blog posts. I'm at 1-2 per month now, and want to increase this to 4.
* Hit 50k pageviews for the year. In 2013 I was just under 10k, but I started in May.
* Attend a Python conference. I've been to meetups but no big ones yet.
* Read a book a month. I read maybe 5 books in 2013.
* Learn some new things. Complete 2 more Coursera classes.

These are all realistic goals and I'm hoping to complete all of them. Have a good 2014 everyone.
